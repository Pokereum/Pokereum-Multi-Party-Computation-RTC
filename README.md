## Pokereum Multi Party Computation RTC
Multi-Party-Computation-RTC represents "poc 1" of the Pokereum real time game state synchrony and private computation between poker nodes on the pokereum network. Note there is no actual security in this version; i.e state signing, private encryption and  authentication which is partially accomplished with integration of the Shadow Poker protocol
